# Unit Testing 

So, unit testing can be fun. Let's make it fun.

Get started with...
```
npm install
```

Next, install mocha globally (or not, your preference). Mocha is a testing platform which makes things easier to unit test than writing from scratch.
```
npm install mocha --global
```

Now you're ready to cook with JS. Run the following to run all tests in your test folder: 
```
mocha test
```
Or you can target tests individually
```
mocha test/testfile.js 
```
